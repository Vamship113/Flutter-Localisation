  "about": "Flutter has come a long way since we last looked into internationalizing a Flutter app using intl and intl_translation. Since then, the cross-platform framework has taken the mobile app development world by storm. With 150K apps and 500K developers in its portfolio, it seems that Flutter—and its delightful development experience—have become a go-to for many developing iOS and Android apps (not to mention web apps). And with the recent Flutter 2 release, the promise of one codebase that works on multiple platforms goes even further: at the time of writing, Flutter 2 supports desktop (Linux, macOS, and Windows) at a near-stable level."
